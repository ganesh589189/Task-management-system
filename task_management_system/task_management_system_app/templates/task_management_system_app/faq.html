  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="question">How do I create a new task?</div>
    <p>Step 1. Start the "Create Basic Task" wizard.
       Step 2. Name the task and give it a description.
       Step 3. Choose when to execute the new task.
       Step 4. Set the action that you want to be executed.
       Step 5. Check the details of the new task and save it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="question">Can I assign a task to multiple users?</div>
    <p>
      You cannot assign a single Jira issue (Task) to multiple users at a time. Best approach is to break the main Task by creating sub-tasks and then assign those sub tasks within the team as needed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="question">How do I mark a task as complete?</div>
    <p>Shift to the Task view by clicking Task in the Navigation Pane.
Right clicking on a task you want to mark complete, and then select Mark Complete from the right-clicking menu.
And then your selected task has been marked as complete, the item is displayed in gray strikethrough text.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="question">How can I prioritize tasks?</div>
    <p>Make a list of all your tasks and write down their deadlines and importance1234
Use a priority matrix, a ranking system, or a goal-oriented approach to separate the urgent from the important tasks1234
Stick to a schedule that reflects your priority tasks and avoid competing priorities234
Tackle your most intense, high-effort tasks first and focus on one task at a time14</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="question">Can I set reminders for tasks?</div>
    <p>
      In Tasks, right-click a task, and then click Add Reminder. ...
In the Custom dialog box, itâ€™s a good idea to change the default Flag to text to a clear action so that when the reminder pop-up appears, the required action is obvious. ...
The Reminder box is already checked, so enter the date and time when you want the reminder pop up to appear.
